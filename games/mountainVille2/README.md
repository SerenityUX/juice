# Mountainville

**Team Members:** Paolo & Thomas

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Celeste meets Farmville but with local co-op multiplayer

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Player 1 and Player 2 are tied together by a rope that they can extend and de-extend and they need to work together to figure out how to race up
platformer levels, gather resources, and rebuild their village after it was destroyed in a tornado that knocked the resources around 
the surrounding mountains. 

It's fun because you have to work with your friend to figure out how to use this rope tieing you together as a tool rather than a nusance. You and
your friends will have that "OMG WE DID IT" moment when you figure out a level and that's what will make it fun.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The game plays with one user using WASD and the other using arrow keys. They can tap 1/2 or Del/Enter to de-extend/extend their rope. They need to 
jump from platform to platform and use the gravitity to pull each other up using the rope. Intense coordination (largely unspoken) will be needed
to make it through the levels.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
We plan to have 3 series, each with about 10min of gameplay. First series is about finding resources to grow your farm, second is about finding 
materials to build back buildings that were destroyed, and the final mountain is where all the villagers were displaced and you have to grab them
to take them back to their homes. Increasing difficulties, size, and complexity of the mountains as you go.
